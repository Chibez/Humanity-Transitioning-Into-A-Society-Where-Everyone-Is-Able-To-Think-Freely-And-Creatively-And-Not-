To transition into a world where everyone can think freely we need to understand that there are important factors that can lead to a world we love and hunger to create for ourselves and for the good of mankind. These are the few we need to get started…….
People and Religion:  A diverse world is where we have found ourselves and religion has been a measure contribution, also it has come with its own advantages and disadvantages. We need to move past the obstacles that religion has placed before us and come to an understanding that we are all humans and there is a need of working together to survive and create a better world, or we might be consumed by our own disunity and discrimination.
Peace:    Peace provides a new way of conceptualizing the way communities can develop in order to sustain peace or to recover from conflict. The focus is too often on responding to violence or the threat of violence. Positive Peace investment promotes the optimum environment for human potential to flourish: in a personal, societal, and economic sense. Grasping Positive Peace doesn’t only prevent violence.
Love:    love is a feeling of a warm personal attachment or deep affection, towards parent, child or a friend. Love is giving your all to people without being selfish or expecting anything back. Love brings people together even in tough times, so we need love in our society not hate. Living with people with different background, do not hinder love, but instead it opens our minds to have cultural perspectives.
Creative imagination: Creativity frees the mind in a way that enables a person to absorb knowledge more easily. It makes processing learning more efficient. Creativity enables alternative ways of thinking. The ability to imagine things pervades our entire existence. It influences everything we do, think about and create. It leads to elaborate theories, dreams and inventions in any profession from the realms of academia to engineering and the arts.
Skill:   Without the right skills, people will languish on the margins of society, technological progress will slow and countries will struggle in the global economy.
Equality:  Equal opportunities mean that wherever you are born in society, you would still have a good chance to reach any job, profession or position in society. Crypto could help the world overcome the world of inequality by building a network of societies and going over  common boundaries. 

How can crypto help humans transition into a world where human survival and creativity is valued and used properly? (Crypto making the world a better place).

Basically, cryptocurrency is electronic money stored in e-wallets or computer files. Also, cryptocurreny is transferred and tracked by using blockchain technology. This technology tracks every update or transfer chronologically. Then, it stores the information cryptically so that anyone can see it. Cryptocurrency may seem like a technology of the future. It has, and will, revolutionize the way we store money, pay for goods and services, and do business. Additionally, there are other ways that cryptocurrency will make the world a better place.

1.	Reduce the risk of fraud.

Fraud is one of the biggest concerns when it comes to almost anything relating to money. cryptocurrency will play a big part in reducing fraud which will also offer peace of mind.

2.	Increase crowdfunding.

Crowdfunding is an increasingly popular way for entrepreneurs to raise money for their concepts and/or products. Investors can make small investments instead of a few investors making large investments. Therefore, this mitigates risk. Without the risk, more investors want to get involved. Cryptocurrency will make the world a better place as it continues to positively impact crowdfunding. Initial coin offerings (ICOs) are centered around cryptocurrency which is used as the source of capital for a startup company’s venture.

3. Keep companies and individuals accountable.

Blockchain technology, which is behind cryptocurrency, cannot be changed like traditional currency. Using the crypto and blockchain technologies keeps companies and individuals accountable. Also, consumers know more about the companies that sell to them.

4. Make foreign money transfers and transactions safer.

Not only does the use of cryptocurrency reduce the danger of carrying cash, it also eliminates any exchange fees or transaction fees. This would keep more money in consumer and vendor pockets. Plus, it would reduce the risk of robberies.

5. Offer a stable alternative to unstable currencies.

Cryptocurrency is accepted worldwide and not subject to exchange and interest rates. It would also provide more stability and certainty to those living in economically volatile countries.

6. Give people control of their own money.

Cryptocurrency allows the control of money to be transferred from the banks and back into the hands of the people. It is not subject to the rules and regulations imposed by banks and other financial institutions. Anytime that more people can get control over their own money, it’s a good thing. And, that’s just another reason why cryptocurrency will make the world a better place.

7. Offer scalability.

Many companies have platforms and programs built out for their specific product and/or service or use an existing service that can be customized to some degree, however, scalability is an issue that many companies eventually face.

8.	Change the money transfer process.

Wires and bank-to-bank transfers are faster and more efficient. However, they still have a long way to go. It can still take some transfers a week or longer to clear and be deposited – especially if the transfer is international. Whether a national or international transfer, cryptocurrency transfers are instant, don’t require any fees, and can be tracked and securely stored in the blockchain.

9.	Make e-commerce stronger.

Not only does the use of cryptocurrency reduce the risk of fraud for shoppers, but it does the same for vendors and sellers. Cryptocurrency transactions are permanent. In addition to the mitigation of risk, using cryptocurrency creates more opportunities for world-wide business.

10.	Encourage scientific advancements.

Cryptocurrency and blockchain technology can help change the scientific roadblocks we face by providing everyone access to real-time data and eliminating the major institutions, foundations, and corporations sitting on important information.

We are collectively dealing with the impact of rapid changes including globalization, technological advances and a different type of economy and job market. You need to become mentally and emotionally strong. You must learn how to possess the ability to adapt, survive and thrive. There is no time for self pity. It's a time for action. Here is what you need to do to succeed in this newly changing world.

1.	Learn to code, write and speak well. You don’t have to be a tech engineer, but it will be helpful to know some coding. It's predicted that many jobs will require this skill in the near term and future. The ability to write well and speak intelligently and communicate clearly and efficiently with people is prized by major corporations. These skills will greatly enhance your marketability.


2.	Tune out the politics and noise.  Let your goals be bigger than the noise around you, be focused and determined to make the best out of yourself.

3.	Read voraciously and keep learning. Most of us graduate school and stop learning. To remain competitive, you have to keep up with all of the developments within your field, as well as new trends that may impact your career. By constantly learning, you’ll be ahead of the crowd that chooses to remain static.

4.	Develop a thick, impenetrable skin. We are in a time of rapid change. The days of working at one company for the entire duration of our careers are over. If you are timid and afraid, the world will devour you. You will need to teach yourself to be strong, unafraid and not intimidated by what the future brings.


5.	Save your money. There will be times when you are in between jobs or earning less money than you did in the past. The mistake most people make is to live beyond their means. If they earn $2, they spend $4—believing that there will always be a steady flow of cash. For every dollar earned, save as much as possible. Having funds for a rainy day makes all the difference in the world. As your funds grow, you’ll have a second income stream. 

6.	Embrace the change. Things change and you will need to be malleable and move with the flow. Instead of being resistant and ignoring your new reality, think of how you can profit and benefit from new circumstances.

We have the ability to reinvent ourselves, start over, take chances, fall on our faces and get back up again. There is a great feeling of taking the reins of your life and building something great for yourself and your family. Humans have built incredible companies and you have all the intelligence and information in your hands on a handheld device. There is absolutely nothing that can stop us from succeeding.
